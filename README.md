# learning-projects
Here you will find a collection of projects or exercises that I created on my way to becoming a programmer.
Some of them were developed privately outside of work, others during my vocational training as an IT specialist at school.

Please note that these projects are not intended to be perfect or fully follow best practices. Their purpose is to help me build a solid understanding of technical skills, which is why they may not always be actively maintained or consistently developed.

Each project usually contains a README file with comments explaining the specific context.
